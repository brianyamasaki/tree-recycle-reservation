    <h1>Troop ??? Tree Pickup Reservation System</h1>
    <p>Our 2021 Christmas Tree Pickup and Recycling Community Service Project was a success. Thank you to all who donated to our troop.</p>

    <p>All trees collected during this service project are chipped and reused as mulch to maintain Kirkland Parks. This mulch is preferred over commercial mulches simply because it's cleaner.</p>
